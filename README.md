# Brick Breaker Game
My first Java project, I created a brick breaking game using JavaFX. 
Use your keybaord to move the paddle in order to hit the ball. When the ball hits a brick it will remove it and you will score a point. Remove all the bricks to win. If the ball hits the bottom of the screen you will lose a life. Lose 3 lives and it is game over.
